A Zsh-Zinit annex (i.e., an extension) that provides functionality that allows:

1. Run programs and scripts without adding anything to `$PATH`,
1. Install and run Ruby [gems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), [Node](https://github.com/npm/cli), and
   [Python](https://python.org) modules from within a local directory with
   [$GEM_HOME](https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-environment),
   [$NODE_PATH](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders) and
   [$VIRTUALENV](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) is automatically set,
1. Run programs, scripts, and functions with automatic `cd` into the plugin or snippet directory, plus also with
   automatic standard output & standard error redirecting.
1. Source scripts through an automatically created function with the above `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, `$VIRTUALENV`, and
   `cd` features available,
1. Create the so-called `shims` known from [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) – the same feature as the first item
   of this enumeration – of running a program without adding anything to `$PATH` with all of the above features, however
   through an automatic **script** created in `$ZPFX/bin`, not a **function** (the first item uses a function-based
   mechanism),
1. Automatic updates of Ruby gems and Node modules during regular plugin and snippet updates with `zinit update …`.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```zsh
zinit light zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-bin-gem-node
```

After executing this command, you can use the new ice mods provided by the annex.


## How it works<a name="how-it-works"></a>
**Note:** The README is somewhat outdated – the `sbin''` ice that creates forwarder scripts (shim) instead of
forwarder-functions (created by the `fbin''` ice and elaborated in this `How it works …` section) turned out to be the
proper, best method for exposing binary programs and scripts. You can jump to the `sbin''` ice
[section](#5-sbingncneopath-to-binary---name-of-the-script-) if you want or read on, as the forwarder-scripts are pretty
similar to the forwarder functions elaborated on in the following text:

Below is a diagram explaining the major feature – exposing a binary program or script through a Zsh function of the same
name:

![diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-bin-gem-node/main/images/diag.png)

This way, there is no need to add anything to `$PATH` – `zinit-annex-bin-gem-node` will automatically create a function
that will wrap the binary and provide it on the command line as if it were placed in the `$PATH`.

Also, as mentioned in the enumeration, the function can automatically export `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, `$VIRTUALENV`
shell variables and also automatically cd into the plugin or snippet directory right before executing the binary, and
then cd back to the original directory after the execution is finished.

Also, as already mentioned, instead of the function, an automatically created script – so-called `shim` – can be used
for the same purpose and with the same functionality, so that the command is accessible practically fully and normally –
not only in the live Zsh session (only within which the functions created by `fbin''` exist) but also from any Zsh
script.

Suppose that you want to install the `junegunn/fzf-bin` plugin from GitHub Releases, which contains only a single file –
the `fzf` binary for the selected architecture. It is possible to do it in the standard way – by adding the plugin's
directory to the `$PATH`:

```zsh
zinit ice as"command" from"github-rel"
zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
```

After this command, the `$PATH` variable will contain, e.g.:

```zsh
% print $PATH
/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

For many such programs loaded as plugins, the PATH can become quite cluttered. I've had 26 entries before switching to
`zinit-annex-bin-gem-node`. To solve this, load with the use of `sbin''` ice provided and handled by
`zinit-annex-bin-gem-node`:

```zsh
zinit ice from"gh-r" sbin"fzf"
zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
```

The `$PATH` will remain unchanged, and a `fzf` forwarder-script, so-called *shim*, will be created in `$ZPFX/bin`
(`~/.zinit/polaris/bin` by default), which is already being added to the `$PATH` by Zinit when it is being sourced:

```zsh
% cat $ZPFX/bin/fzf
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

function fzf {
    local bindir="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin"
    "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}

fzf "$@"
```

Running the script will forward the call to the program accessed through an embedded path to it. Thus, no `$PATH`
changes are needed!

### sbin<a name="sbin"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage"></a>

```zsh
sbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -> {name-of-the-script}];' 
```

It creates the so-called `shim` known from `rbenv` – a wrapper script that forwards the call to the actual binary. The
script is always created under the same standard and single `$PATH` entry: `$ZPFX/bin` (which is `~/.zinit/polaris/bin`
by default).

The flags have the same meaning as with `fbin''` ice.

#### Example<a name="sbin-example"></a>

```zsh
% zinit delete junegunn/fzf-bin
Delete /home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin?
[yY/n…]
y
Done (action executed, exit code: 0)
% zinit ice from"gh-r" sbin"fzf"
% zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
…installation messages…
% cat $ZPFX/bin/fzf
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

function fzf {
    local bindir="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin"
    "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}

fzf "$@"
```

Running the script will forward the call to the program accessed through an embedded path to it. Thus, no `$PATH`
changes are needed!

---

#### Empty `sbin` ICE<a name="empty-sbin"></a>

**The ice can be empty**. It will then try to create the shim for:

- trailing component of the `id_as` ice, e.g., `id_as'exts/git-my'` → it'll check if a file `git-my` exists, and if yes,
  create the shim `git-my`,
- the plugin name, e.g., for `paulirish/git-open`, it'll check if a file `git-open` exists, and if yes, create the shim
  `git-open`,
- trailing component of the snippet URL,
- for any alphabetically first executable file.

---

#### Modifier `!` for `sbin` ICE<a name="sbin-bypass-rc"></a>

By default, the generated shim uses the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env zsh`, which starts `zsh` with all user and system configuration files.

When the `sbin` ICE is prefixed with `!`, the generated shim is instead created with:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env -S zsh -fd
```

This starts `zsh` in **NO RCS mode**, which means that both `zshenv` and `zshrc` (local and global) are skipped. This can significantly **reduce startup time by 100-200ms**, as no unnecessary shell initialization occurs.

**When to use `!`:**
- Use `!` when launching a **command-line program** where startup speed is important.
- Avoid `!` if the binary depends on configuration from `.zshrc` or `.zshenv`.
- **Edge case:** If the shim is executed from an external GUI launcher (e.g., desktop icons), omitting `!` may be necessary to load expected shell environment variables.

**Example usage:**

```zsh
% zinit ice from"gh-r" sbin"!fzf"
% zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
```

The resulting shim will start with the shebang:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env -S zsh -fd
```

---

#### When to Use `sbin` vs. `lbin`<a name="sbin-vs-lbin"></a>

For simple binaries with no dependencies, `sbin` may not be necessary. Instead, a **symlink-based** approach can be used via the `lbin` ICE provided by the [`zinit-annex-binary-symlink`](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-binary-symlink) annex.

In practice, you can safely use `lbin` instead of `sbin` if:
- The binary **does not** spawn subprocesses.
- The binary **does not** require sourcing anything from the plugin directory.
- The binary **does not** need to modify `$PATH`.

Remember: the modifier `!` together with `lbin` creates a soft instead of a hard link.

For example:

```zsh
zinit ice from"gh-r" lbin'!bat(.exe|) -> bat'
zinit load @sharkdp/bat
```

This method avoids unnecessary shims and links the binary into `$ZPFX/bin`, making it directly executable.

If your binary requires a proper execution environment (e.g., `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, or `cd` to the plugin directory), use `sbin` instead.

### fbin<a name="fbin"></a>

```
fbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; …' 
```

Creates a wrapper function with the same name as the path's last segment or as `{name-of-the-function}`. The
optional preceding flags mean:

- `g` – set `$GEM_HOME` variable to `{plugin-dir}`,
- `n` – set `$NODE_PATH` variable to `{plugin-dir}/node_modules`,
- `p` – set `$VIRTUALENV` variable to `{plugin-dir}/venv`,
- `c` – cd to the plugin's directory before running the program and then cd back after it has been run,
- `N` – append `&>/dev/null` to the call of the binary, i.e., redirect both standard output and standard error to
  `/dev/null`,
- `E` – append `2>/dev/null` to the call of the binary, i.e., redirect standard error to `/dev/null`,
- `O` – append `>/dev/null` to the binary call, i.e., redirect standard output to `/dev/null`.

#### Example:<a name="example"></a>

```zsh
% zinit ice from"gh-r" fbin"g:fzf -> myfzf"
% zinit load junegunn/fzf-bin
% which myfzf
myfzf () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin"
        local -x GEM_HOME="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/junegunn---fzf-bin"
        "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}
```

**The ice can be empty**. It will then try to create the function for:

- trailing component of the `id_as` ice, e.g., `id_as'exts/git-my'` → it'll check if a file `git-my` exists, and if yes,
  create the function `git-my`,
- the plugin name, e.g., for `paulirish/git-open`, it'll check if a file `git-open` exists, and if yes, create the
  function `git-open`,
- trailing component of the snippet URL,
- for any alphabetically first executable file.

### gem<a name="gem"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage-1"></a>

```
gem'{gem-name};' 
```

```
gem"[{path-to-binary} <-] !{gem-name} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; …"
```

Installs the gem of `{gem-name}` with `$GEM_HOME` set to the plugin's or snippet's directory. In other words,
the gem and its dependencies will be installed locally in that directory.

The second form also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin''` ice.

#### Example<a name="example-1"></a>

```zsh
% zinit ice gem'!asciidoctor'
% zinit load zdharma-continuum/null
% which asciidoctor
asciidoctor () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/zdharma---null/bin" 
        local -x GEM_HOME="/home/sg/.zinit/plugins/zdharma---null" 
        "$bindir"/"asciidoctor" "$@"
}
```

### node<a name="node"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage-2"></a>

```
node'{node-module}; …'
```

node'\[{path-to-binary} \<-\] !{node-module} \[-> {name-of-the-function}\];

Installs the node module named `{node-module}` inside the plugin's or snippet's directory.

The second form also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin''` ice.

#### Example<a name="example-2"></a>

```zsh
zi for \
    as'null' \
    id-as'remark' \
    node'remark <- !remark-cli -> remark; remark-man' \
  @zdharma-continuum/null
```

Verify:

```console
$ type remark
remark is a shell function

$ which remark
remark () {
        local bindir="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/remark/node_modules/.bin"
        local -x NODE_PATH="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/remark"/node_modules
        local -xU PATH="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/remark"/node_modules/.bin:"$bindir":"$PATH"
        "$bindir"/"remark" "$@"
}

$ remark --version
remark: 14.0.3, remark-cli: 11.0.0
```

In this case, the name of the binary program provided by the node module is different from its name, hence the second
form with the `b <- a -> c` syntax has been used.

### pip<a name="pip"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage-3"></a>

Install the Python package named `{pip-package}` inside a plugin or snippet directory.

```zsh
pip'{pip-package}`
```

Create a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin` ice.

```zsh
pip'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{pip-package} [-> {name-of-the-function}]'
```

#### Example<a name="example-3"></a>

```zsh
zi for \
    as'null' \
    id-as'ansible' \
    pip'ansible <- !ansible -> ansible; ansible-lint' \
  @zdharma-continuum/null
```

Verify:

```console
$ type ansible
ansible is a shell function

$ which ansible
ansible () {
        local bindir="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible/venv/bin"
        local -x VIRTUALENV="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible"/venv
        local -xU PATH="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible"/venv/bin:"$bindir":"$PATH"
        "$bindir"/"ansible" "$@"
}

$ ansible --version
ansible [core 2.15.4]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/Users/e109082/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /Users/e109082/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible/venv/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.6 (default, Aug 12, 2023, 04:13:21) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)] (/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/ansible/venv/bin/python3)
  jinja version = 3.1.2
  libyaml = True
```

In this case, the name of the binary program provided by the pip package is different from its name, the second form
with the `b <- a -> c` syntax has been used.

### fmod<a name="fmod"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage-4"></a>

The meaning of the `g`,`n`, and `c` flags is the same as in the `fbin''` ice.

```zsh
fmod'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{function-name}'
```

You can wrap the given function with the ability to set `$GEM_HOME`.

```
fmod'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{function-name} -> {wrapping-function-name}'
```

#### Example<a name="example-4"></a>

```zsh
foobar(){ +zi-log -n '{m} foobar function -> '; pwd; }
zi for \
    as'null' \
    fmod'cgn:foobar' \
    id-as'fmod-demo' \
  @zdharma-continuum/null
```

Verify:

```console
$ foobar
==> foobar function -> /Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/fmod-demo
```

```console
$ which foobar
foobar () {
    local -x GEM_HOME="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/fmod-demo"
    local -x NODE_PATH="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/fmod-demo"/node_modules
    local oldpwd="/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/zdharma-continuum---zinit-annex-bin-gem-node"
    () {
        setopt localoptions noautopushd
        builtin cd -q "/Users/e109082/.local/share/zinit/plugins/fmod-demo"
    }
    "foobar--za-bgn-orig" "$@"
    () {
        setopt localoptions noautopushd
        builtin cd -q "$oldpwd"
    }
}
```

### fsrc<a name="fsrc"></a>

#### Usage<a name="usage-5"></a>

```
fsrc'\[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:\]{path-to-script}\[ -> {name-of-the-function}\];'
```

```
ferc'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-script}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; …'
```

Creates a wrapper function that, at each invocation, sources the given file. The second ice, `ferc''` works the same
with the single difference that it uses `eval "$(<{path-to-script})"` instead of `source "{path-to-script}"` to load the
script.

#### Example<a name="example-5"></a>

Create a sample script:

```zsh
cat << 'EOF' > foo-script
+zi-log "I am ${0} running in ${PWD}"
EOF
```

Test `bar-func` is not currently defined.

```console
$ type bar-func
bar-func not found
```

Define `bar-func` with `ferc` ice:

```zsh
zinit for \
    id-as'fsrc-demo' \
    fsrc"$PWD/foo-script -> bar-func" \
    ferc"$PWD/foo-script" \
    as'null' \
  @zdharma-continuum/null
```

Test `bar-func` is now defined and run it

```console
$ type bar-func
bar-func is a shell function

$ bar-func
I am /Users/e109082/foo-script running in /Users/e109082
```

The contents of `bar-func`

```console
$ which bar-func
bar-func () {
        local bindir="/Users/e109082"
        local -xU PATH="$bindir":"$PATH"
        () {
                source "$bindir"/"foo-script"
        } "$@"
}
```

**The ices can be empty**. They will then try to create the function for the trailing component of the `id-as` ice and
the other cases, in the same way as with the `fbin` ice.

## shim-list<a name="shim-list"></a>

An additional Zinit command is provided by this annex: `shim-list`. It searches for and displays shims
stored under `$ZPFX/bin`. Example invocation:

![shim-list invocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit-annex-bin-gem-node/main/images/shim-list.png)

Available options are:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Cygwin Support<a name="cygwin-support"></a>

The `sbin''` ice has an explicit Cygwin support – it creates additional, **extra shim files** – Windows batch scripts
that allow running the shielded applications from, e.g., Windows run dialog – if the `~/.zinit/polaris/bin` directory is
being added to the Windows `PATH` environment variable, for example (it is a good idea to do so, IMHO). The Windows
shims have the same name as the standard ones (which are also being created, normally), plus the `.cmd` extension.

### Example<a name="example-6"></a>

```zsh
zinit pack=bgn for firefox
```
